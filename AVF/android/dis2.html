						<h5>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h5>
						<p>It seems as though JQuery Mobile is not the most Semantic HTML which in tern becomes less accessible.  In MIU and ASD, I thought JQM was amazing at transforming simple list items and buttons into amazing looking mobile experiences; however, now after taking into consideration screen readers and better Semantic HTML I can see how my previous app would be very difficult to dive through.  It seemed as all JQM is wrapped in div elements which don’t truly give good accessibility to the user.  I have since dropped all JQM and brought back very simple and what I believe is Semantic HTML.</p> 
						<h5>2. Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h5>
						<p>Screen readers are amazing for the visually impaired but the Internet and many sites are developed around images and the visual feel.  Also when websites have numerous links, it can become overwhelming to try and navigate all the links to find exactly what you need.  Some visually impaired users may become very familiar with certain websites due to the complexity and frustrations with navigating new and unfamiliar websites.</p> 
						<p>I would try to fix this within my websites and mobile applications by keeping pages very simplistic and to the point.  Using minimal links except to navigate the website or mobile application would be beneficial.  The good thing about mobile applications/web apps is that they need to be designed around simplicity.  The screen real estate does not allow for extreme complexity.  I would also insure that all visual elements have alt text to make sense of each image without seeing the image.</p> 
						<h5>3. Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h5>
						<p>iPhone: The iphone has a built-in VoiceOver screen reader and the zoom magnifier feature to help with the visually impaired.  iPhone also supports more than 30 bluetooth wireless braille displays which can work with VoiceOver.</p> 
						<p>Galaxy Nexus 4.0: The Galaxy Nexus have TalkBack which is a service provided by Google.  It helps to describe results of actions that a user may do with the phone (opening an app and notifications).  SoundBack is another service that lets the user put different sounds to different phone actions.</p> 
						<h5>4. Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h5>
						<p>Mobile Accessibility for Android – Sprint created an app for visually impaired customers.  It allows users to easily move around their phones by reading aloud the text located under their finger.</p> 
						<p>IDEAL Magnifier – this turns your phone into a large magnifying glace through the camera.  This can help visually impaired readers to magnify newspapers, magazines, books or even the internet page.</p>
