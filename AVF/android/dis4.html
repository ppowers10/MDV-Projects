						<h5>1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h5>
                        <p>Games are the top sellers throughout the US.  Other apps that are popular are social media, news and weathe and mobile search.</p>
                        <h5>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h5>
                        <p>Comic book readers, handwritten note taking apps and other productivity apps, then games.</p>
                        <h5>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h5>
                        <p>Great Britain is very similar to the United States.  The English like Google maps, weather applications, social media and also games.</p>
                        <h5>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h5>
                        <p>All three markets are similar in that Games are recognized as some of the top sellers.  If I could single out certain categories within each market I would say that the U.S. tends to fvor games and social media.  Japan is more into productivity applications rather than games and entertainment.  Lastly Great Britain is into games and weather related applications.</p> 
                        <h5>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h5>
                        <p>While I couldn’t find the exact figure, what I came across was the percentage of users with Android as their OS.  In the United States, Android accounts for roughly 40% of users.  In Japan, Android accounted for roughly 49% of users.  Lastly, in the UK, Android accounts for roughly 22%.  In Japan and in the US, the Apple iOS competition seems to be neck in neck, but UK is still dominated by iOS with even blackberry above Android users; however this seems to be changing quickly with the decline in RIM.  It seems that if you are going to develop for Android devices in the U.S. you should also develop for Great Britain solely for fact that both applications would be developed in English.  What you shouldn’t do is develop an Android application solely for Great Britain at this point because of the lake of market share.  It may be more beneficial to develop for the US for monetary purposes that can translate over to Great Britain.  In terms of Japan and developing there, Android as an OS has gained ground on iOS and seems to be potentially have the chance to overtake iOS as the main platform.</p> 
                        <p>Within each market it seem that Gingerbread has the largest market share.  As a developer, it would be important to continue to see the shift in OS trends and to see 4.0 continue to grow.</p> 
                        <h5>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h5>
                        <p>In the UK, the number of plans you can choose from seems unlimited compared to the US and seems to be very specialized per the type of phone.  Looking at one of the most popular carriers is Vodafone the plans range from £10 all the way to £62.  What seems to be very different is that the plans only come with 1 GB of data included.  Each additional 50MB is £1which can get very expensive very quickly.  The next GB will cost close to £20.</p>
                        <p>The US has similar costs across carriers.  They typically have costs for data within tiers that start as low as 300MBs and typically go up to 5GBs.  The tiers for bandwidth range from $20 - $50.  Verizon and AT&T follow these tiers pretty closely.  Sprint, being another large carrier, is known for it’s unlimited data plans.  While it is unlimited, it is still the cost of the highest plans on Verizon and AT&T and at those high levels, the majority of users don’t go over their limits.</p>
                        <p>In Japan, data plans seem to be mostly unlimited across the board.  There was debate by many carriers to begin placing caps on data usage but the possibility of losing consumers has deterred to officially put in place those caps.  One of the most popular carriers, au, charges for phone, text and unlimited data starting at ~$83. For the unlimited data portion the user is paying ~$67.  When comparing to a plan in the U.S. the numbers seem very comparable.</p> 
                        <p>When thinking about developing, it seems that the data limits in Japan and the US are more forgiving and you can really pack a large amount of data into applications.  In the UK, you have to be very careful as to how much data your users are using as it can become very expensive very quick.</p>   
                        <h5>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h5>
                        <p>I would steer away from the UK initially if I was developing for Android because of the lower market share within the Android OS.  If I was trying to really get an idea flowing and generate some possible downloads, I would start in the US and even branch into Japan appropriately solely due to their bandwidth costs per user.</p>
