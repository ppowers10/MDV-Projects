			<h5>1. What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able
				 to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only? (just a hint - iOS can be the tricky one)</h5>
			<p>Using PhoneGap you can access a lot of features.  Some include the camera, contacts, geolocations, audio and video.</p>
			<h5>2. For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?</h5>
			<p>I'd like to implement geolocation.  My app old CRUD app was about making recommendations 
				and I had a "location" feild that the user could fill in.  I'd rather have a geo location option for users to get their current location rather then typing it in.</p>
			<h5>3. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h5>
			<p>Taking the research and workflow one step at a time is the biggest lesson that I have learned.  For example, I think 
				creating the HTML first and then adding css, and lastly adding javascript can help manage the workflow.  
				Jumping around from one file to the other right from the start can get tricky and I start to think to much.  
				Have the HTML solidified (more or less) makes working on everything else that much easier.  Adding in pictures 
				and icons goes hand in hand with css.  In terms of research, I think that reading references and guides in full is important.
				I've noticed many times that I felt comfortable implementing a new plugin or jQuery Mobile functionality to only find out that
				I was not able to fully make everything work.  I would go back to the reference and continue to read through the examples and
				documentation to find why I was having issues and how to correct them.  If I had read through everything fully the first time
				I might not have run into the same issues.</p>
			<h5>4. Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h5>
			<p>My current CRUD app looks good overall, but I want to clean up the "final" drill-down page for each recommendations.  These drill-down
				pages have the overall information I want, but I have yet to make it look visually appealing.</p>
			<h5>5. If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h5>
			<p>I'd really like to figure out the geolocation functionality if possible and implement it as best as possible into my current
				CRUD app.  My current app is based around friends making recommendations (kind of like Yelp).  The current list of recommendations
				are restaurants, events, bars, attractions, and shopping.  All of these recommendations could have a geolocation easily
				attached to them in a way that is extrememly user friendly and less time consuming then typing in the location manually.</p>
